# CASH - The C Again SHell

The initial goal for this project was to develop a shell which could process C language scripts, but more efficiently and powerfully than the known CSH. The compatibily to BASH has been kept where possible, for example with the keyboard input and the PS1 variable, for which the control characters are exactly the same as the ones in BASH. The following features are available in CASH:

## Main instructions

### Compiling CASH
```
$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure
$ make
```
The executable `cash` is available inside the `src` folder.

### Testing CASH
```
$ cp src/cash tests/cash
$ bash tests/run_test.sh
```

### Executing CASH
```
$ ./cash
```

### Executing CASH scripts
```
$ ./cash <script.cash>
```

### Help and version
```
$ ./cash -hv
```

## Keyboard Input

CASH provides the user a friendly and functional terminal.
The following keys (and combinations) can be used:

- **Backspace** - removes the previous character
- **Home** - moves the cursor to the beginning of the line
- **End** - moves the cursor to the end of the line
- **Left and Right arrows** - moves the cursor between the characters in the line
- **Up and Down arrows** - selects and navigates the command history
- **Ctrl + K** - erases all characters till the end of the line
- **Ctrl + L** - cleans the entire screen
- **Ctrl + W** - erases the word closest to the cursor
- **Tab** - auto-complete

## PS1 Variable

CASH is totally compatible with BASH in relation to the PS1 variable. ALL control characters supported by BASH are also supported by CASH.

## Command History

User commands are stored in the file .cash\_profile. When CASH starts, this file is loaded and the history is stored in memory using a circular list and a hash table. The list is used for quick navigation with the keyword arrows and the hash table for reverse search, although it is currently not accessible via the terminal. The file is only updated when CASH successfully exits.

## Auto-Complete

CASH is equipped with a simple but extremely functional auto-complete, which can be used to finish file or directory names.

## Executing commands

Any command can be called normally via CASH terminals. The PATH environment variable is used for command search, which allows users to use simple command names, not needing a complete path. The command search is executed via the system call (syscall) `execvp`. CASH also allows redirecting in and output using the following:

```
command1 > output.txt
command1 >> output.txt

command2 < input.txt
command2 << input.txt
```

Using the `>` operand the file will be replaced by the output from `command1` meanwhile `>>` will only append the output to whatever content the destination file already had.

Pipes `|` are also supported by CASH:

```
command1 | command2
```

In the above given example, the `command1` output will be used as input for `command2`. It is important to note that CASH also tries to support multiple pipes:

```
command1 | command2 | command3 | ...
```

Internally a binary tree is built to correctly execute the commands.

## Job Control

CASH offers possiblity to control _Jobs_ through the following _built-in_ commands:

- `jobs` - Lists all current processes (stopped, killed, etc)
- `bg` - shifts a process to background
- `fg` - shifts a process to foreground

The sintax of those commands are the same as in BASH. The following signals can also be used in process:

- **Ctrl + Z** - Stops the current process
- **Ctrl + C** - Sends a SIGINT to kill the current process

## Script language support
